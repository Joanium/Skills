---

Stream Quality Adaptation Planning is an expert-level specialized systems skill for operating in technical domains where physical, protocol, or computational limits dominate design choices. The emphasis here is sequencing work, dependencies, and proof points so execution moves quickly without creating blind risk.

## When To Use

- Use this when Stream Quality Adaptation Planning has tight performance, correctness, or hardware constraints.
- Use this when generic software assumptions create misleading design shortcuts.
- Use this when the system needs focused validation harnesses, not only normal application tests.
- Use this when integration cost and operational realism matter as much as algorithmic elegance.

## Core Principles

- Make the operating envelope explicit before optimizing the implementation.
- Correctness and observability come before aggressive tuning.
- Prototype the critical path before integrating the surrounding ecosystem.
- Measure cost, throughput, and failure behavior together.
- Specialized systems fail in non-obvious ways, so validation must be domain-aware.

## Decision Questions

- What must be true before Stream Quality Adaptation Planning can start safely?
- Which dependency has the highest chance of slipping or changing?
- What is the smallest milestone that proves the plan is still viable?
- Which tasks can proceed in parallel without creating integration debt?
- What contingency path exists if the primary plan stalls?

## Workflow

1. Define scope, exclusions, and the readiness threshold for starting.
2. Break the work into milestones that each reduce a specific risk.
3. Map dependencies, handoffs, and decision points that can block flow.
4. Assign owners, due dates, and readiness criteria for every milestone.
5. Add contingency options for likely slips, blocked work, or invalidated assumptions.
6. Run a standing replanning loop based on evidence, not calendar optimism.

## Deliverables

- A milestone plan for Stream Quality Adaptation Planning with explicit gating criteria.
- A dependency map showing blockers, handoffs, and critical path items.
- A contingency and rollback map for the most likely plan failures.
- A status model that distinguishes risk, delay, and readiness clearly.

## Tradeoffs

- Aggressive deadlines versus quality of risk reduction.
- Parallel execution versus coordination overhead.
- Detailed planning upfront versus adaptive replanning.
- Local team efficiency versus cross-team synchronization.

## Signals To Watch

- Correctness rate under representative workloads and corner cases.
- Latency, throughput, and resource saturation at the true bottleneck.
- Recovery behavior after partial failure or corrupted inputs.
- Operational overhead required to keep the system healthy.
- Gap between lab performance and real deployment performance.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Scope and exclusions are documented.
- [ ] Critical path items are visible and owned.
- [ ] Every milestone has a proof point, not just a date.
- [ ] Contingencies exist for the top risks.
- [ ] Status reporting distinguishes signal from optimism.
- [ ] The plan can survive one major assumption being wrong.

## Common Failure Modes

- Plans that track tasks but not risk reduction.
- Dependencies hidden until the week they block delivery.
- Milestones defined by effort spent rather than proof gained.
- No contingency path when assumptions fail.
