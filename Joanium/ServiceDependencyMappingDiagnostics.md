Service Dependency Mapping Diagnostics is an expert-level infrastructure skill for reducing operational risk while keeping rollout control, recovery, and ownership explicit. The emphasis here is turning vague symptoms into testable hypotheses fast enough to reduce mean time to clarity.

## When To Use

- Use this when Service Dependency Mapping Diagnostics changes service availability, deployment safety, or recovery behavior.
- Use this when multiple services, regions, or operators need a shared operating model.
- Use this when hidden dependencies or high blast radius make informal rollout decisions unsafe.
- Use this when production incidents show that the current control plane is too implicit.

## Core Principles

- Blast radius should be designed and limited before the first rollout step.
- Recovery is part of the design, not an appendix after launch.
- Operational ownership must be obvious under time pressure.
- Automate the checks humans are most likely to skip when stressed.
- Prefer progressive exposure over all-at-once change when the system is not yet proven.

## Decision Questions

- What changed most recently in or around Service Dependency Mapping Diagnostics?
- What is the blast radius: user segment, workload, environment, or dependency?
- Which signals are primary evidence, and which are misleading side effects?
- How can the issue be isolated or reproduced safely?
- What evidence would eliminate the top hypothesis?

## Workflow

1. Stabilize the system enough to preserve evidence and reduce further harm.
2. Build a timeline of symptoms, changes, and relevant environmental context.
3. Generate a hypothesis tree and rank it by likelihood and impact.
4. Isolate variables with the smallest safe experiments first.
5. Confirm root cause with evidence, not narrative convenience.
6. Record remediation, missing telemetry, and prevention follow-ups.

## Deliverables

- An evidence-backed timeline for Service Dependency Mapping Diagnostics.
- A ranked hypothesis tree.
- A remediation log with confirmed and rejected paths.
- A telemetry gap list discovered during investigation.

## Tradeoffs

- Speed of mitigation versus quality of evidence preservation.
- Broad changes versus narrow experiments.
- Confidence in a likely root cause versus proof of causality.
- Immediate operator action versus waiting for stronger signals.

## Signals To Watch

- Change failure rate and mean time to recovery after rollout issues.
- Rollback success rate and the time needed to restore steady state.
- Error budget burn and saturation during deployments or failovers.
- Alert quality: noise rate, missing coverage, and acknowledgement delays.
- Configuration drift, dependency skew, and recovery drill pass rate.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The blast radius is defined.
- [ ] A timeline exists before strong conclusions are made.
- [ ] Hypotheses are ranked and explicitly falsifiable.
- [ ] Evidence is preserved before major resets or rollbacks.
- [ ] Rejected hypotheses are recorded to avoid loops.
- [ ] Prevention work is captured after confirmation.

## Common Failure Modes

- Jumping to a familiar cause without evidence.
- Destroying evidence during the first response.
- Changing multiple variables at once and losing causality.
- Stopping after mitigation without understanding the trigger.
