---

Deep Link Recovery Paths Diagnostics is an expert-level client platform skill for shipping resilient mobile or desktop behavior across devices, stores, networks, and operating-system constraints. The emphasis here is turning vague symptoms into testable hypotheses fast enough to reduce mean time to clarity.

## When To Use

- Use this when Deep Link Recovery Paths Diagnostics affects release risk, device behavior, or user trust during degraded conditions.
- Use this when platform restrictions or background execution rules shape the design.
- Use this when telemetry needs to explain failures that cannot be reproduced locally.
- Use this when crash, battery, or network issues demand a stronger operating model than feature-by-feature fixes.

## Core Principles

- Platform constraints should shape the architecture before implementation debt accumulates.
- Release quality depends on telemetry, rollback options, and operator clarity.
- Offline and degraded states are part of the product, not edge cases.
- Device diversity should be treated as a planning input, not a testing afterthought.
- User trust is lost faster on client platforms because failures feel personal and immediate.

## Decision Questions

- What changed most recently in or around Deep Link Recovery Paths Diagnostics?
- What is the blast radius: user segment, workload, environment, or dependency?
- Which signals are primary evidence, and which are misleading side effects?
- How can the issue be isolated or reproduced safely?
- What evidence would eliminate the top hypothesis?

## Workflow

1. Stabilize the system enough to preserve evidence and reduce further harm.
2. Build a timeline of symptoms, changes, and relevant environmental context.
3. Generate a hypothesis tree and rank it by likelihood and impact.
4. Isolate variables with the smallest safe experiments first.
5. Confirm root cause with evidence, not narrative convenience.
6. Record remediation, missing telemetry, and prevention follow-ups.

## Deliverables

- An evidence-backed timeline for Deep Link Recovery Paths Diagnostics.
- A ranked hypothesis tree.
- A remediation log with confirmed and rejected paths.
- A telemetry gap list discovered during investigation.

## Tradeoffs

- Speed of mitigation versus quality of evidence preservation.
- Broad changes versus narrow experiments.
- Confidence in a likely root cause versus proof of causality.
- Immediate operator action versus waiting for stronger signals.

## Signals To Watch

- Crash-free sessions, ANR or hang rate, and fatal signal concentration.
- Battery, network, and storage impact by feature or build channel.
- Release adoption curve and rollback or hotfix frequency.
- Store review trends and support volume after targeted changes.
- Task completion rate under degraded connectivity or background constraints.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The blast radius is defined.
- [ ] A timeline exists before strong conclusions are made.
- [ ] Hypotheses are ranked and explicitly falsifiable.
- [ ] Evidence is preserved before major resets or rollbacks.
- [ ] Rejected hypotheses are recorded to avoid loops.
- [ ] Prevention work is captured after confirmation.

## Common Failure Modes

- Jumping to a familiar cause without evidence.
- Destroying evidence during the first response.
- Changing multiple variables at once and losing causality.
- Stopping after mitigation without understanding the trigger.
