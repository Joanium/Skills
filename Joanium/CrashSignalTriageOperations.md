Crash Signal Triage Operations is an expert-level client platform skill for shipping resilient mobile or desktop behavior across devices, stores, networks, and operating-system constraints. The emphasis here is repeatable day-two execution under real load, incomplete information, and ordinary human error.

## When To Use

- Use this when Crash Signal Triage Operations affects release risk, device behavior, or user trust during degraded conditions.
- Use this when platform restrictions or background execution rules shape the design.
- Use this when telemetry needs to explain failures that cannot be reproduced locally.
- Use this when crash, battery, or network issues demand a stronger operating model than feature-by-feature fixes.

## Core Principles

- Platform constraints should shape the architecture before implementation debt accumulates.
- Release quality depends on telemetry, rollback options, and operator clarity.
- Offline and degraded states are part of the product, not edge cases.
- Device diversity should be treated as a planning input, not a testing afterthought.
- User trust is lost faster on client platforms because failures feel personal and immediate.

## Decision Questions

- What are the recurring operational decisions inside Crash Signal Triage Operations?
- Which alerts or dashboards should trigger human action, and which should not?
- What information does the operator need in the first five minutes?
- Where are handoffs likely to fail during rotation changes or incidents?
- Which manual steps are risky enough to automate or heavily constrain?

## Workflow

1. Map the steady-state workflows, alert sources, and operator decision tree.
2. Define the minimum context, dashboards, and commands needed to act safely.
3. Write the runbook for common cases, degraded cases, and escalation triggers.
4. Test the handoff path across roles, rotations, and time zones.
5. Run drills to validate the operational model under time pressure.
6. Use incident and toil data to remove fragile manual paths.

## Deliverables

- A runbook for Crash Signal Triage Operations covering routine and degraded modes.
- An alert map with severity, owner, and first action.
- A handoff template for cross-team or on-call transitions.
- A toil reduction backlog driven by repeated operator pain.

## Tradeoffs

- Operator flexibility versus procedural safety.
- Automation speed versus recoverability when automation fails.
- Local expertise versus portable runbooks.
- Rich dashboards versus cognitive overload during incidents.

## Signals To Watch

- Crash-free sessions, ANR or hang rate, and fatal signal concentration.
- Battery, network, and storage impact by feature or build channel.
- Release adoption curve and rollback or hotfix frequency.
- Store review trends and support volume after targeted changes.
- Task completion rate under degraded connectivity or background constraints.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Operators can identify first actions quickly.
- [ ] Alerts map to decisions, not mere observations.
- [ ] Runbooks cover degraded and ambiguous cases.
- [ ] Handoffs are documented and practiced.
- [ ] Manual steps with high blast radius are constrained.
- [ ] Toil data feeds improvement work.

## Common Failure Modes

- Runbooks that assume the original author is online.
- Alerts with no clear next action.
- Operational steps that rely on tribal memory.
- Too much automation without a recovery path when automation fails.
