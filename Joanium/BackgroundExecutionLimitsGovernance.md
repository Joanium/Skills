---

Background Execution Limits Governance is an expert-level client platform skill for shipping resilient mobile or desktop behavior across devices, stores, networks, and operating-system constraints. The emphasis here is on ownership, policy, exception handling, and auditability so the domain does not decay into ad hoc decisions.

## When To Use

- Use this when Background Execution Limits Governance affects release risk, device behavior, or user trust during degraded conditions.
- Use this when platform restrictions or background execution rules shape the design.
- Use this when telemetry needs to explain failures that cannot be reproduced locally.
- Use this when crash, battery, or network issues demand a stronger operating model than feature-by-feature fixes.

## Core Principles

- Platform constraints should shape the architecture before implementation debt accumulates.
- Release quality depends on telemetry, rollback options, and operator clarity.
- Offline and degraded states are part of the product, not edge cases.
- Device diversity should be treated as a planning input, not a testing afterthought.
- User trust is lost faster on client platforms because failures feel personal and immediate.

## Decision Questions

- Who sets the policy for Background Execution Limits Governance, and who is allowed to grant exceptions?
- Which behaviors are required, forbidden, or conditionally allowed?
- What evidence proves compliance or justified non-compliance?
- How often should the policy be reviewed against operational reality?
- What enforcement mechanism is credible for this team and toolchain?

## Workflow

1. Define the governed surface area and why it needs formal policy.
2. Assign policy ownership, approvers, and escalation paths for disagreement.
3. Specify baseline rules, approved exceptions, and evidence requirements.
4. Implement enforcement through tooling, review, and reporting loops.
5. Track exceptions with expiry, renewal rules, and risk acceptance.
6. Run periodic governance reviews to retire bad rules and close bypass paths.

## Deliverables

- A policy document for Background Execution Limits Governance with explicit scope.
- An ownership and approver matrix.
- An exception workflow with expiry and review rules.
- A compliance report or dashboard definition.

## Tradeoffs

- Strict enforcement versus developer or operator throughput.
- Central consistency versus local adaptability.
- Formal evidence versus administrative burden.
- Wide policy scope versus clarity and enforceability.

## Signals To Watch

- Crash-free sessions, ANR or hang rate, and fatal signal concentration.
- Battery, network, and storage impact by feature or build channel.
- Release adoption curve and rollback or hotfix frequency.
- Store review trends and support volume after targeted changes.
- Task completion rate under degraded connectivity or background constraints.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Policy scope and ownership are unambiguous.
- [ ] Rules distinguish required behavior from guidance.
- [ ] Exceptions have expiry, owner, and rationale.
- [ ] Enforcement is realistic for the current tooling.
- [ ] Review cadence exists to remove stale policy.
- [ ] Reporting can show whether the policy is working.

## Common Failure Modes

- Policies that nobody can actually enforce.
- Permanent exceptions that quietly become the norm.
- No evidence trail for risky decisions.
- Governance reviews that only add rules and never retire them.
