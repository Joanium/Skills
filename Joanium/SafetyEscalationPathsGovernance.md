Safety Escalation Paths Governance is an expert-level AI systems skill for making model-assisted behavior reliable, auditable, and economically sane in production. The emphasis here is on ownership, policy, exception handling, and auditability so the domain does not decay into ad hoc decisions.

## When To Use

- Use this when Safety Escalation Paths Governance influences user-visible output, automation, or safety-sensitive decisions.
- Use this when prompts, retrieval, tools, and policies interact in ways that are hard to reason about informally.
- Use this when you need explicit acceptance criteria before increasing traffic, autonomy, or model authority.
- Use this when regressions, unsafe behavior, or cost spikes require a more disciplined operating model.

## Core Principles

- Separate model behavior from system behavior; both need design.
- Assume variance and clamp it with contracts, validation, and fallback paths.
- Evaluate against adversarial, ambiguous, and low-context cases, not only happy-path prompts.
- Make prompt, model, retrieval, and tool changes attributable so debugging stays causal.
- Human escalation should be deliberate, fast, and observable.

## Decision Questions

- Who sets the policy for Safety Escalation Paths Governance, and who is allowed to grant exceptions?
- Which behaviors are required, forbidden, or conditionally allowed?
- What evidence proves compliance or justified non-compliance?
- How often should the policy be reviewed against operational reality?
- What enforcement mechanism is credible for this team and toolchain?

## Workflow

1. Define the governed surface area and why it needs formal policy.
2. Assign policy ownership, approvers, and escalation paths for disagreement.
3. Specify baseline rules, approved exceptions, and evidence requirements.
4. Implement enforcement through tooling, review, and reporting loops.
5. Track exceptions with expiry, renewal rules, and risk acceptance.
6. Run periodic governance reviews to retire bad rules and close bypass paths.

## Deliverables

- A policy document for Safety Escalation Paths Governance with explicit scope.
- An ownership and approver matrix.
- An exception workflow with expiry and review rules.
- A compliance report or dashboard definition.

## Tradeoffs

- Strict enforcement versus developer or operator throughput.
- Central consistency versus local adaptability.
- Formal evidence versus administrative burden.
- Wide policy scope versus clarity and enforceability.

## Signals To Watch

- Task success rate against a human-reviewed gold set.
- Fallback frequency, escalation rate, and unresolved exception count.
- Latency and token cost by path, prompt family, and customer tier.
- Tool call failure rate and recovery success percentage.
- Unsafe output rate, policy violation rate, and false-positive review burden.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Policy scope and ownership are unambiguous.
- [ ] Rules distinguish required behavior from guidance.
- [ ] Exceptions have expiry, owner, and rationale.
- [ ] Enforcement is realistic for the current tooling.
- [ ] Review cadence exists to remove stale policy.
- [ ] Reporting can show whether the policy is working.

## Common Failure Modes

- Policies that nobody can actually enforce.
- Permanent exceptions that quietly become the norm.
- No evidence trail for risky decisions.
- Governance reviews that only add rules and never retire them.
