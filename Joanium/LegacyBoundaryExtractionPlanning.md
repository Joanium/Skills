Legacy Boundary Extraction Planning is an expert-level engineering systems skill for making architecture, standards, and change management explicit enough to scale beyond individual memory. The emphasis here is sequencing work, dependencies, and proof points so execution moves quickly without creating blind risk.

## When To Use

- Use this when Legacy Boundary Extraction Planning affects codebase shape, team interfaces, or long-term delivery speed.
- Use this when unspoken standards or ownership gaps are causing repeated waste.
- Use this when migrations need structure so they can finish without destabilizing the platform.
- Use this when local optimizations are starting to damage cross-team coherence.

## Core Principles

- Incremental evolution usually beats dramatic rewrites under uncertainty.
- Standards only work when exceptions are explicit and reviewable.
- Ownership should be visible in the code, tooling, and review paths.
- Compatibility rules need to be designed before change volume rises.
- Architecture quality is measured by how teams change the system, not only by diagrams.

## Decision Questions

- What must be true before Legacy Boundary Extraction Planning can start safely?
- Which dependency has the highest chance of slipping or changing?
- What is the smallest milestone that proves the plan is still viable?
- Which tasks can proceed in parallel without creating integration debt?
- What contingency path exists if the primary plan stalls?

## Workflow

1. Define scope, exclusions, and the readiness threshold for starting.
2. Break the work into milestones that each reduce a specific risk.
3. Map dependencies, handoffs, and decision points that can block flow.
4. Assign owners, due dates, and readiness criteria for every milestone.
5. Add contingency options for likely slips, blocked work, or invalidated assumptions.
6. Run a standing replanning loop based on evidence, not calendar optimism.

## Deliverables

- A milestone plan for Legacy Boundary Extraction Planning with explicit gating criteria.
- A dependency map showing blockers, handoffs, and critical path items.
- A contingency and rollback map for the most likely plan failures.
- A status model that distinguishes risk, delay, and readiness clearly.

## Tradeoffs

- Aggressive deadlines versus quality of risk reduction.
- Parallel execution versus coordination overhead.
- Detailed planning upfront versus adaptive replanning.
- Local team efficiency versus cross-team synchronization.

## Signals To Watch

- Lead time, change failure rate, and rollback frequency.
- Policy compliance drift and exception backlog size.
- Dependency graph health, ownership clarity, and orphaned modules.
- Test determinism, flake rate, and review rework caused by unclear standards.
- Migration throughput versus the amount of legacy surface retired.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Scope and exclusions are documented.
- [ ] Critical path items are visible and owned.
- [ ] Every milestone has a proof point, not just a date.
- [ ] Contingencies exist for the top risks.
- [ ] Status reporting distinguishes signal from optimism.
- [ ] The plan can survive one major assumption being wrong.

## Common Failure Modes

- Plans that track tasks but not risk reduction.
- Dependencies hidden until the week they block delivery.
- Milestones defined by effort spent rather than proof gained.
- No contingency path when assumptions fail.
