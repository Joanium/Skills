Reliability Review Boards Playbook is an expert-level engineering systems skill for making architecture, standards, and change management explicit enough to scale beyond individual memory. The emphasis here is response execution: who does what, in what order, with what evidence, when conditions are degraded.

## When To Use

- Use this when Reliability Review Boards Playbook affects codebase shape, team interfaces, or long-term delivery speed.
- Use this when unspoken standards or ownership gaps are causing repeated waste.
- Use this when migrations need structure so they can finish without destabilizing the platform.
- Use this when local optimizations are starting to damage cross-team coherence.

## Core Principles

- Incremental evolution usually beats dramatic rewrites under uncertainty.
- Standards only work when exceptions are explicit and reviewable.
- Ownership should be visible in the code, tooling, and review paths.
- Compatibility rules need to be designed before change volume rises.
- Architecture quality is measured by how teams change the system, not only by diagrams.

## Decision Questions

- What threshold or trigger causes Reliability Review Boards Playbook to move from monitoring to active response?
- Who is the incident or response lead for the first fifteen minutes?
- What containment steps are safe before the full diagnosis is complete?
- How will stakeholders, users, or regulators be informed if needed?
- What condition allows the team to stand down or transition to follow-up work?

## Workflow

1. Classify the event, severity, and triggering evidence.
2. Assign command, owners, and communication responsibilities immediately.
3. Execute containment actions that reduce blast radius without destroying evidence.
4. Restore critical functionality through the safest viable path.
5. Communicate status, uncertainty, and next actions at a fixed cadence.
6. Close with a post-event review that updates the playbook itself.

## Deliverables

- A trigger table for Reliability Review Boards Playbook.
- An action sequence for the first response window.
- A communication template for internal and external updates.
- A post-event capture template for decisions, evidence, and follow-ups.

## Tradeoffs

- Fast containment versus evidence preservation.
- Centralized command versus local decision speed.
- Broad communication versus noise and confusion.
- Immediate restoration versus fully clean remediation.

## Signals To Watch

- Lead time, change failure rate, and rollback frequency.
- Policy compliance drift and exception backlog size.
- Dependency graph health, ownership clarity, and orphaned modules.
- Test determinism, flake rate, and review rework caused by unclear standards.
- Migration throughput versus the amount of legacy surface retired.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Trigger thresholds are explicit.
- [ ] Command roles and backups are named.
- [ ] Containment steps preserve critical evidence where possible.
- [ ] Communication cadence and audience are predefined.
- [ ] Stand-down conditions are clear.
- [ ] The playbook is updated after every meaningful use.

## Common Failure Modes

- No one owns command in the first response window.
- Containment destroys the evidence needed for follow-up.
- Communication is improvised and inconsistent.
- The same playbook mistakes repeat because updates never happen.
