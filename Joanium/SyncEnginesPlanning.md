description: Practical guidance for planning and executing sync engines planning with clear scope, tradeoffs, and validation steps.

Sync Engines Planning focuses on shipping client applications that stay resilient across device constraints, stores, and unreliable networks.

## Core Principles

- Platform constraints should shape the design early.
- Release quality depends on telemetry and rollback readiness.
- Mobile and desktop edge cases need explicit test coverage.

## Workflow

1. Map device, network, and platform-specific constraints.
2. Define release, monitoring, and support requirements.
3. Test the experience across representative devices and degraded states.
4. Iterate using crash, retention, and support signals.

## Common Mistakes

- Testing only on ideal hardware and connectivity.
- Ignoring store, OS, or device policy constraints.
- Shipping without a plan for offline or partial failure behavior.
