Crash Signal Triage Reliability is an expert-level client platform skill for shipping resilient mobile or desktop behavior across devices, stores, networks, and operating-system constraints. The emphasis here is designing graceful degradation, recovery paths, and explicit reliability targets before the system is stressed.

## When To Use

- Use this when Crash Signal Triage Reliability affects release risk, device behavior, or user trust during degraded conditions.
- Use this when platform restrictions or background execution rules shape the design.
- Use this when telemetry needs to explain failures that cannot be reproduced locally.
- Use this when crash, battery, or network issues demand a stronger operating model than feature-by-feature fixes.

## Core Principles

- Platform constraints should shape the architecture before implementation debt accumulates.
- Release quality depends on telemetry, rollback options, and operator clarity.
- Offline and degraded states are part of the product, not edge cases.
- Device diversity should be treated as a planning input, not a testing afterthought.
- User trust is lost faster on client platforms because failures feel personal and immediate.

## Decision Questions

- What are the most likely and most damaging failure modes in Crash Signal Triage Reliability?
- Which failures can be masked, and which require explicit user or operator visibility?
- What is the recovery objective for time, data loss, and trust impact?
- How will the team know the system is leaving its safe operating envelope?
- Which dependencies make reliability contingent on someone elses behavior?

## Workflow

1. Define the reliability targets, assumptions, and allowed degradation behavior.
2. Enumerate failure modes across dependencies, operators, data, and environment.
3. Design fallback paths, recovery procedures, and state repair options.
4. Instrument early detection and clear escalation criteria.
5. Test failure handling with drills, chaos cases, or targeted simulation.
6. Review incidents and near misses to update the reliability model.

## Deliverables

- A failure mode catalog for Crash Signal Triage Reliability.
- A target matrix for availability, recovery, and data durability.
- A documented fallback and repair procedure.
- A drill or fault-injection plan for the critical risks.

## Tradeoffs

- Higher reliability versus delivery speed and cost.
- Automatic recovery versus operator control.
- Strict consistency versus availability during failures.
- Redundancy versus complexity and drift risk.

## Signals To Watch

- Crash-free sessions, ANR or hang rate, and fatal signal concentration.
- Battery, network, and storage impact by feature or build channel.
- Release adoption curve and rollback or hotfix frequency.
- Store review trends and support volume after targeted changes.
- Task completion rate under degraded connectivity or background constraints.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Reliability targets are explicit.
- [ ] Failure modes cover dependencies and operator error.
- [ ] Degraded behavior is designed and communicated.
- [ ] Detection and escalation paths are defined.
- [ ] Recovery procedures are tested, not hypothetical.
- [ ] Near misses feed the reliability model.

## Common Failure Modes

- Reliability work that only adds redundancy without recovery clarity.
- No degraded mode, forcing binary success or total failure.
- Targets stated without instrumentation to measure them.
- Assuming dependencies will be reliable enough by default.
