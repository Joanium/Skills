---

Interaction Latency Budgets Design is an expert-level frontend skill for making client behavior understandable, resilient, and consistent across design and engineering. The emphasis here is on interfaces, invariants, failure handling, and why one structure is safer than its alternatives.

## When To Use

- Use this when Interaction Latency Budgets Design shapes user trust through responsiveness, clarity, or failure handling.
- Use this when behavior needs to hold across browsers, devices, accessibility tools, or partial outages.
- Use this when design intent is repeatedly lost between mocks, implementation, and QA.
- Use this when interface regressions are costly because users discover them before the team does.

## Core Principles

- Users experience system behavior, not implementation details.
- Loading, empty, error, and recovery states deserve first-class design.
- Accessibility constraints belong in the design model from the start.
- Client observability should explain both perceived and actual performance.
- Handoffs get stronger when acceptance criteria are visible and testable.

## Decision Questions

- What are the core boundaries, contracts, and invariants in Interaction Latency Budgets Design?
- Which failure modes should be absorbed, and which should surface immediately?
- How will the design evolve without breaking consumers or operators?
- Where is coupling acceptable, and where is it too expensive?
- What assumptions does the design make about scale, behavior, or inputs?

## Workflow

1. Clarify requirements, non-goals, and the constraints that shape the design.
2. Map the boundary diagram, responsibilities, and trust or data flows.
3. Define contracts, state transitions, and invariants that must hold.
4. Design failure handling, fallback behavior, and operability hooks.
5. Stress the design against realistic scenarios, edge cases, and growth patterns.
6. Review the tradeoffs, migration path, and reversibility before adoption.

## Deliverables

- An architecture or boundary diagram for Interaction Latency Budgets Design.
- A contract or state model that captures invariants explicitly.
- A migration and compatibility sketch for affected consumers.
- A tradeoff record describing why this design beat the alternatives.

## Tradeoffs

- Modularity versus coordination overhead.
- Strict contracts versus flexibility of change.
- Simplicity now versus extensibility later.
- Immediate performance versus debuggability and safety.

## Signals To Watch

- Interaction latency, visual stability, and completion rate for key journeys.
- Client-side error rate and recovery success without hard refresh.
- Accessibility regression count and unresolved severity.
- Cross-browser defect rate and device-class skew.
- Support tickets or session replays linked to the targeted journey.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Boundaries and responsibilities are explicit.
- [ ] Invariants are named and testable.
- [ ] Failure handling is designed, not implied.
- [ ] Compatibility and migration are addressed.
- [ ] The design was tested against realistic scenarios.
- [ ] Rejected alternatives are captured honestly.

## Common Failure Modes

- Designs that describe components but not their contracts.
- No explanation of failure behavior or degraded mode.
- Coupling hidden behind convenience abstractions.
- Migration concerns deferred until implementation is underway.
