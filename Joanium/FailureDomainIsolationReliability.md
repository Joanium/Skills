---

Failure Domain Isolation Reliability is an expert-level infrastructure skill for reducing operational risk while keeping rollout control, recovery, and ownership explicit. The emphasis here is designing graceful degradation, recovery paths, and explicit reliability targets before the system is stressed.

## When To Use

- Use this when Failure Domain Isolation Reliability changes service availability, deployment safety, or recovery behavior.
- Use this when multiple services, regions, or operators need a shared operating model.
- Use this when hidden dependencies or high blast radius make informal rollout decisions unsafe.
- Use this when production incidents show that the current control plane is too implicit.

## Core Principles

- Blast radius should be designed and limited before the first rollout step.
- Recovery is part of the design, not an appendix after launch.
- Operational ownership must be obvious under time pressure.
- Automate the checks humans are most likely to skip when stressed.
- Prefer progressive exposure over all-at-once change when the system is not yet proven.

## Decision Questions

- What are the most likely and most damaging failure modes in Failure Domain Isolation Reliability?
- Which failures can be masked, and which require explicit user or operator visibility?
- What is the recovery objective for time, data loss, and trust impact?
- How will the team know the system is leaving its safe operating envelope?
- Which dependencies make reliability contingent on someone elses behavior?

## Workflow

1. Define the reliability targets, assumptions, and allowed degradation behavior.
2. Enumerate failure modes across dependencies, operators, data, and environment.
3. Design fallback paths, recovery procedures, and state repair options.
4. Instrument early detection and clear escalation criteria.
5. Test failure handling with drills, chaos cases, or targeted simulation.
6. Review incidents and near misses to update the reliability model.

## Deliverables

- A failure mode catalog for Failure Domain Isolation Reliability.
- A target matrix for availability, recovery, and data durability.
- A documented fallback and repair procedure.
- A drill or fault-injection plan for the critical risks.

## Tradeoffs

- Higher reliability versus delivery speed and cost.
- Automatic recovery versus operator control.
- Strict consistency versus availability during failures.
- Redundancy versus complexity and drift risk.

## Signals To Watch

- Change failure rate and mean time to recovery after rollout issues.
- Rollback success rate and the time needed to restore steady state.
- Error budget burn and saturation during deployments or failovers.
- Alert quality: noise rate, missing coverage, and acknowledgement delays.
- Configuration drift, dependency skew, and recovery drill pass rate.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Reliability targets are explicit.
- [ ] Failure modes cover dependencies and operator error.
- [ ] Degraded behavior is designed and communicated.
- [ ] Detection and escalation paths are defined.
- [ ] Recovery procedures are tested, not hypothetical.
- [ ] Near misses feed the reliability model.

## Common Failure Modes

- Reliability work that only adds redundancy without recovery clarity.
- No degraded mode, forcing binary success or total failure.
- Targets stated without instrumentation to measure them.
- Assuming dependencies will be reliable enough by default.
