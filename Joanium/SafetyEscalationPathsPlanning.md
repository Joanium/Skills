Safety Escalation Paths Planning is an expert-level AI systems skill for making model-assisted behavior reliable, auditable, and economically sane in production. The emphasis here is sequencing work, dependencies, and proof points so execution moves quickly without creating blind risk.

## When To Use

- Use this when Safety Escalation Paths Planning influences user-visible output, automation, or safety-sensitive decisions.
- Use this when prompts, retrieval, tools, and policies interact in ways that are hard to reason about informally.
- Use this when you need explicit acceptance criteria before increasing traffic, autonomy, or model authority.
- Use this when regressions, unsafe behavior, or cost spikes require a more disciplined operating model.

## Core Principles

- Separate model behavior from system behavior; both need design.
- Assume variance and clamp it with contracts, validation, and fallback paths.
- Evaluate against adversarial, ambiguous, and low-context cases, not only happy-path prompts.
- Make prompt, model, retrieval, and tool changes attributable so debugging stays causal.
- Human escalation should be deliberate, fast, and observable.

## Decision Questions

- What must be true before Safety Escalation Paths Planning can start safely?
- Which dependency has the highest chance of slipping or changing?
- What is the smallest milestone that proves the plan is still viable?
- Which tasks can proceed in parallel without creating integration debt?
- What contingency path exists if the primary plan stalls?

## Workflow

1. Define scope, exclusions, and the readiness threshold for starting.
2. Break the work into milestones that each reduce a specific risk.
3. Map dependencies, handoffs, and decision points that can block flow.
4. Assign owners, due dates, and readiness criteria for every milestone.
5. Add contingency options for likely slips, blocked work, or invalidated assumptions.
6. Run a standing replanning loop based on evidence, not calendar optimism.

## Deliverables

- A milestone plan for Safety Escalation Paths Planning with explicit gating criteria.
- A dependency map showing blockers, handoffs, and critical path items.
- A contingency and rollback map for the most likely plan failures.
- A status model that distinguishes risk, delay, and readiness clearly.

## Tradeoffs

- Aggressive deadlines versus quality of risk reduction.
- Parallel execution versus coordination overhead.
- Detailed planning upfront versus adaptive replanning.
- Local team efficiency versus cross-team synchronization.

## Signals To Watch

- Task success rate against a human-reviewed gold set.
- Fallback frequency, escalation rate, and unresolved exception count.
- Latency and token cost by path, prompt family, and customer tier.
- Tool call failure rate and recovery success percentage.
- Unsafe output rate, policy violation rate, and false-positive review burden.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Scope and exclusions are documented.
- [ ] Critical path items are visible and owned.
- [ ] Every milestone has a proof point, not just a date.
- [ ] Contingencies exist for the top risks.
- [ ] Status reporting distinguishes signal from optimism.
- [ ] The plan can survive one major assumption being wrong.

## Common Failure Modes

- Plans that track tasks but not risk reduction.
- Dependencies hidden until the week they block delivery.
- Milestones defined by effort spent rather than proof gained.
- No contingency path when assumptions fail.
