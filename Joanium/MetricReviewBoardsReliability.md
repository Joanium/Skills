Metric Review Boards Reliability is an expert-level data systems skill for turning analysis and pipelines into governed, trusted, and operationally stable assets. The emphasis here is designing graceful degradation, recovery paths, and explicit reliability targets before the system is stressed.

## When To Use

- Use this when Metric Review Boards Reliability affects downstream metrics, decisions, or customer-facing data products.
- Use this when schemas, lineage, or quality expectations need to survive team and tool changes.
- Use this when backfills, migrations, or new data products risk breaking shared definitions.
- Use this when trust in the data is low and consumers need a stronger operating contract.

## Core Principles

- Shared definitions are more valuable than local convenience.
- Every important metric needs lineage, ownership, and a validation story.
- Model data around decisions and entities, not only source-system tables.
- Backfills and migrations are product changes, not mere pipeline chores.
- Trust is built by reconciling deltas, freshness, and semantic intent together.

## Decision Questions

- What are the most likely and most damaging failure modes in Metric Review Boards Reliability?
- Which failures can be masked, and which require explicit user or operator visibility?
- What is the recovery objective for time, data loss, and trust impact?
- How will the team know the system is leaving its safe operating envelope?
- Which dependencies make reliability contingent on someone elses behavior?

## Workflow

1. Define the reliability targets, assumptions, and allowed degradation behavior.
2. Enumerate failure modes across dependencies, operators, data, and environment.
3. Design fallback paths, recovery procedures, and state repair options.
4. Instrument early detection and clear escalation criteria.
5. Test failure handling with drills, chaos cases, or targeted simulation.
6. Review incidents and near misses to update the reliability model.

## Deliverables

- A failure mode catalog for Metric Review Boards Reliability.
- A target matrix for availability, recovery, and data durability.
- A documented fallback and repair procedure.
- A drill or fault-injection plan for the critical risks.

## Tradeoffs

- Higher reliability versus delivery speed and cost.
- Automatic recovery versus operator control.
- Strict consistency versus availability during failures.
- Redundancy versus complexity and drift risk.

## Signals To Watch

- Freshness, completeness, and reconciliation pass rate for critical datasets.
- Metric drift versus source-of-truth calculations.
- Schema change failure rate and downstream breakage count.
- Adoption of certified definitions versus ad hoc forks.
- Warehouse cost by workload, consumer, and retention tier.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Reliability targets are explicit.
- [ ] Failure modes cover dependencies and operator error.
- [ ] Degraded behavior is designed and communicated.
- [ ] Detection and escalation paths are defined.
- [ ] Recovery procedures are tested, not hypothetical.
- [ ] Near misses feed the reliability model.

## Common Failure Modes

- Reliability work that only adds redundancy without recovery clarity.
- No degraded mode, forcing binary success or total failure.
- Targets stated without instrumentation to measure them.
- Assuming dependencies will be reliable enough by default.
