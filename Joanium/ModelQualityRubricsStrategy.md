Model Quality Rubrics Strategy is an expert-level AI systems skill for making model-assisted behavior reliable, auditable, and economically sane in production. The emphasis here is on choosing the operating model, decision boundaries, and success criteria before local optimizations become policy by accident.

## When To Use

- Use this when Model Quality Rubrics Strategy influences user-visible output, automation, or safety-sensitive decisions.
- Use this when prompts, retrieval, tools, and policies interact in ways that are hard to reason about informally.
- Use this when you need explicit acceptance criteria before increasing traffic, autonomy, or model authority.
- Use this when regressions, unsafe behavior, or cost spikes require a more disciplined operating model.

## Core Principles

- Separate model behavior from system behavior; both need design.
- Assume variance and clamp it with contracts, validation, and fallback paths.
- Evaluate against adversarial, ambiguous, and low-context cases, not only happy-path prompts.
- Make prompt, model, retrieval, and tool changes attributable so debugging stays causal.
- Human escalation should be deliberate, fast, and observable.

## Decision Questions

- What decision is Model Quality Rubrics Strategy supposed to improve over the next planning horizon?
- Which constraints are fixed, and which are merely habits that can be challenged?
- Where does failure in Model Quality Rubrics Strategy create the largest technical, business, or trust cost?
- Which teams must own inputs, decisions, and follow-through?
- What evidence would prove that the current direction is wrong?

## Workflow

1. Frame the objective, decision horizon, and non-negotiable constraints.
2. Map stakeholders, dependencies, and the highest-cost failure boundaries.
3. Compare realistic operating models and choose the default path deliberately.
4. Define guardrails, decision rights, and the metrics that will govern tradeoffs.
5. Record rejected alternatives and the reasons they lost.
6. Publish the strategy with a review cadence and conditions for revision.

## Deliverables

- A written decision statement for Model Quality Rubrics Strategy.
- A ranked constraint register with explicit owners.
- A risk register tied to the chosen operating model.
- A review cadence with triggers for strategy revision.

## Tradeoffs

- Flexibility versus standardization across teams or products.
- Short-term delivery speed versus long-term operating cost.
- Centralized control versus local autonomy.
- Preventive investment now versus reactive cost later.

## Signals To Watch

- Task success rate against a human-reviewed gold set.
- Fallback frequency, escalation rate, and unresolved exception count.
- Latency and token cost by path, prompt family, and customer tier.
- Tool call failure rate and recovery success percentage.
- Unsafe output rate, policy violation rate, and false-positive review burden.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] The problem, horizon, and constraints are explicit.
- [ ] Alternatives were compared rather than hand-waved.
- [ ] Decision rights and owners are named.
- [ ] Success and failure signals are measurable.
- [ ] Review timing is scheduled, not implied.
- [ ] The chosen strategy can be explained to a skeptical peer.

## Common Failure Modes

- Strategy written as slogans instead of decisions.
- Objectives that cannot be measured or challenged.
- No owner for enforcing tradeoffs.
- No review date, causing silent drift.
