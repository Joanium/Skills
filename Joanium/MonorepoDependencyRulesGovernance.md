description: Expert-level guidance for monorepo dependency rules governance, including decision criteria, workflow, tradeoffs, signals, review checkpoints, and failure modes.
---

Monorepo Dependency Rules Governance is an expert-level engineering systems skill for making architecture, standards, and change management explicit enough to scale beyond individual memory. The emphasis here is on ownership, policy, exception handling, and auditability so the domain does not decay into ad hoc decisions.

## When To Use

- Use this when Monorepo Dependency Rules Governance affects codebase shape, team interfaces, or long-term delivery speed.
- Use this when unspoken standards or ownership gaps are causing repeated waste.
- Use this when migrations need structure so they can finish without destabilizing the platform.
- Use this when local optimizations are starting to damage cross-team coherence.

## Core Principles

- Incremental evolution usually beats dramatic rewrites under uncertainty.
- Standards only work when exceptions are explicit and reviewable.
- Ownership should be visible in the code, tooling, and review paths.
- Compatibility rules need to be designed before change volume rises.
- Architecture quality is measured by how teams change the system, not only by diagrams.

## Decision Questions

- Who sets the policy for Monorepo Dependency Rules Governance, and who is allowed to grant exceptions?
- Which behaviors are required, forbidden, or conditionally allowed?
- What evidence proves compliance or justified non-compliance?
- How often should the policy be reviewed against operational reality?
- What enforcement mechanism is credible for this team and toolchain?

## Workflow

1. Define the governed surface area and why it needs formal policy.
2. Assign policy ownership, approvers, and escalation paths for disagreement.
3. Specify baseline rules, approved exceptions, and evidence requirements.
4. Implement enforcement through tooling, review, and reporting loops.
5. Track exceptions with expiry, renewal rules, and risk acceptance.
6. Run periodic governance reviews to retire bad rules and close bypass paths.

## Deliverables

- A policy document for Monorepo Dependency Rules Governance with explicit scope.
- An ownership and approver matrix.
- An exception workflow with expiry and review rules.
- A compliance report or dashboard definition.

## Tradeoffs

- Strict enforcement versus developer or operator throughput.
- Central consistency versus local adaptability.
- Formal evidence versus administrative burden.
- Wide policy scope versus clarity and enforceability.

## Signals To Watch

- Lead time, change failure rate, and rollback frequency.
- Policy compliance drift and exception backlog size.
- Dependency graph health, ownership clarity, and orphaned modules.
- Test determinism, flake rate, and review rework caused by unclear standards.
- Migration throughput versus the amount of legacy surface retired.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Policy scope and ownership are unambiguous.
- [ ] Rules distinguish required behavior from guidance.
- [ ] Exceptions have expiry, owner, and rationale.
- [ ] Enforcement is realistic for the current tooling.
- [ ] Review cadence exists to remove stale policy.
- [ ] Reporting can show whether the policy is working.

## Common Failure Modes

- Policies that nobody can actually enforce.
- Permanent exceptions that quietly become the norm.
- No evidence trail for risky decisions.
- Governance reviews that only add rules and never retire them.
